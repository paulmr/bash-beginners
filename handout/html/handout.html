Unix in general. If you don’t know what Bash is, or if you’ve just
used other people’s Bash scripts but their internal workings remain
mysterious, or you’ve tried to use Bash and ended up confused by its
idiosyncrasies then this session will hopefully be helpful.</p><p>By the end of it you will:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">

take commands from the user and execute them. Bash is probably the
most common shell and is usually the default on modern OSs that need
one.</p><p>It’s main job is to execute other programs on your behalf, and this
follows the Unix philosphy of having small programs that do one thing
well, and then giving you the ability to glue these programs together
to achieve larger tasks.</p><p>For example, the shell will provide you with the ability to <code class="literal">pipe' the
output of one command into the input of another, as in the command
line below: it uses the `wc</code> program to count the number of words in
each file in the current directory, and then pipe this to the <code class="literal">sort</code>
command:</p><pre class="screen">wc -w * | sort -n</pre><p>Most commands you run, even the most basic ones, are external programs
to which the shell is able to delegate its work. To see this in
action, you can type <code class="literal">which ls</code>: this will show you where the binary
that implements the <code class="literal">ls</code> command is held.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="_exercise_1_getting_help"></a>Exercise 1: Getting help</h2></div></div></div><div class="sidebar"><div class="titlepage"></div><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p class="simpara">

Fri Sep 11 :&gt;</pre></div><p>Most Unix-like systems, incuding OSX, come with a set of documentation
files call man pages, which document in great detail everything you
could ever want to know about a command on the system. They can be
accessed by typing <code class="literal">man</code> followed by the name of the command you want
to learn about, and the best place to start is perhaps the man page
about the man command itself, and you can search man pages with the
<code class="literal">apropos</code> command:</p><pre class="screen">$ apropos compress
gzip (1)             - compress or expand files
[...]</pre><p>The man pages are also published on line and this can be a more
convenient way to view them. Just be aware of differences that can
crop up between different OSs and distributions (using the man command
should give you the answer for the specific system you are using).</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="_exercise_2_locating_files"></a>Exercise 2: Locating files</h2></div></div></div><div class="sidebar"><div class="titlepage"></div><p>Compress all of the files in a directory that don’t match the <code class="literal">*.gz</code>

scripting.</p><p>Bash (and shells in general) makes the assumption that what you are
trying to do is execute system commands, and so that is it’s default
interpretation of what you want to do, with everything else as just
glue that sticks those elements together.</p><p>As a counter example, one way we might solve this exercise in Scala
would be a program like this:</p><pre class="programlisting">import java.io.File

def process(f: File, indent: Int = 0): Unit = {
  if(f.isDirectory)
    for(child &lt;- f.listFiles) process(child)
  else if(!f.getName.endsWith(".gz"))
    /* ... either call out to `gzip` or use the JDK library... */
    Runtime.getRuntime.exec(Array("gzip", f.getPath))
}

process(new File("."))</pre><p>However, with we achieve this in a single line in bash:</p><div class="sidebar"><div class="titlepage"></div><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem">
Look at the <code class="literal">gzip</code> man page, you can see that we can pass multiple
files to it.
</li><li class="listitem">
Type <code class="literal">gzip !(*.gz)</code>. The wildcard pattern will get expanded to a
list of files and these will be passed to gzip as its arguments.
</li></ol></div></div><p>There are various situations in which Bash will replace special text
with some computed values, and this is usually referred to in the docs
as <code class="literal">EXPANSION</code>, e.g parameter expansion, filename expansion etc. Not
suprisingly the latter is for finding and inserting files that match a
wildcard patterns (this also has the charming moniker <code class="literal">globbing</code> in
shell parlance).</p><p>By default you are limited to a couple of simple wildcards, but when
the <code class="literal">extglob</code> (for extended globbing) setting is enabled you have
significantly more options available.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0; margin-right: 10%;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>Why is this behind an option? Backwards compatibility: if you try to
use the pattern that you need without setting this option, you will
get an error caused by the fact that it already has another meaning.</p></div><div class="sidebar"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><p class="title"><strong>Optional: recursive wildcards</strong></p></div></div></div><p>The Scala example is descending the directory recursively. One way to
achieve this in Bash might be to combinine smaller tools to get the
job done. For example, you’ve got <code class="literal">find</code>
(<a class="ulink" href="http://linux.die.net/man/1/find" target="_top">http://linux.die.net/man/1/find</a>) which will do this for you, and you
can usefully combine it with <code class="literal">xargs</code>
(<a class="ulink" href="http://linux.die.net/man/1/xargs" target="_top">http://linux.die.net/man/1/xargs</a>).</p><p>Or, again you can delve into the many options of Bash:</p><pre class="screen">$ ls *.gz
a.gz  c.gz
$ ls */*.gz
dir1/a.gz
$ shopt -s globstar
$ ls **/*.gz
a.gz  c.gz  dir1/a.gz  dir1/dir2/c.gz</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="_exercise_3_writing_scripts"></a>Exercise 3: Writing scripts</h2></div></div></div><p>Everything that you write on the Bash command line can be put into a
file and executed as a script. The simplest way to run it is just to
pass it along as the first argument to a new instance of Bash.</p><div class="sidebar"><div class="titlepage"></div><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem">
Open up a text editor and write the commands from the previous
exercise in a file.
</li><li class="listitem">
Run <code class="literal">bash &lt;filename&gt;</code> to execute your script.
</li></ol></div></div><p>Another way to do it is to add the execute permission and add a
special line at the top which tells the OS to pass the file to Bash:</p><p>If <code class="literal">hello.sh</code> contains:</p><pre class="screen">#!/bin/bash
echo "hello world"</pre><p>we can:</p><pre class="screen">$ chmod u+x hello.sh
$ ./hello.sh
hello world
$ mv hello.sh hello
$ ./hello
hello world</pre><p>In both of these instances, a new copy of Bash will be run which will
house the script while it runs. This means that it won’t be able to
access the variables and other things that are owned by the starting
instance.</p><p>In that case, you can either use the <code class="literal">source</code> command to execute the
commands from the file in the same environment exactly as if you typed
them at the command line, or you can <code class="literal">export</code> those resource to
child processes.</p><pre class="screen">$ ./hello
hello world
$ bash ./hello.sh
Hello
$ cat hello.sh
echo "Hello $NAME"
$ NAME="Superman"
$ bash hello.sh
Hello
$ source hello.sh
Hello Superman
$ export NAME=Spiderman
$ bash hello.sh
Hello Spiderman</pre></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="_exercise_4_doing_maths_in_bash_is_painful_8230"></a>Exercise 4: Doing maths in Bash is painful…</h2></div></div></div><p>If we want to add up the total size of all of the files in a
directory, we need to do some arithmetic which is quite fiddly in
Bash, because of it’s default assumption that you are just typing
commands and thier arguments.</p><div class="sidebar"><div class="titlepage"></div><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem">
Search for <code class="literal">Arithmetic Expansion</code> in the man page to find the way to

which is separate from <code class="literal">$(())</code>. Confusing, right?!</p></div></div><p>This exercise provides a good example of why shell scripts can often
be very fiddly, because things which are easy in traditional
programming languages can be difficult in Bash as it requires you to
jump through hoops to shift into <code class="literal">programming mode</code>.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="_conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div></div><p>We have looked at what Bash is, and just as importantly what it
<span class="strong"><strong>isn’t</strong></span>. Hopefully you have also gained some signposts that will point
the way to getting documention on things that are new when reading or
modifying existing scripts. We have also seen some of the subtleties
that can confuse beginners with unexpected behaviour when running
scripts.</p><p>There are of course a lot more commands and other odds and ends that
make up Bash’s full toolset, and we will cover these in later
sessions.</p></div></div></body></html>
