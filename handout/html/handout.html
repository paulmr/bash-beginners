scripting and Unix in general. If you don’t know what Bash is, or if
you’ve just used other people’s Bash scripts without really
understanding them, or you’ve tried to use Bash and ended up confused
by its idiosyncracies then this session is probably for you.</p><p>By the end of it you will hopefully:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">

take commands from the user and execute them. Bash is probably the
most common shell and is usually the default on modern OSs that need
one.</p><p>It’s main job is to execute other programs on your behalf, and this
follows the Unix philosphy of having small programs that do one thing
well, and then giving you the ability to glue these programs together
to achieve larger tasks.</p><p>For example, the shell will provide you with the ability to ‘pipe’ the
output of one command into the input of another.</p><p>For example, this line will use the <code class="literal">wc</code> program to count the number
of words in each file in the current directory, and then pipe this to
the <code class="literal">sort</code>:</p><pre class="screen">wc -w * | sort -n</pre><p>Most commands you run, even the most basic ones, are external programs
to which the shell is able to delegate, for example <code class="literal">which ls</code> will
show you where the binary that shows you a list of files is stored.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="_getting_help"></a>Getting help</h2></div></div></div><p>Most Unix-like systems, incuding OSX, come with a set of documentation
files call man pages, which document in great detail everything you
could ever want to know about a command on the system. They can be
accessed by typing <code class="literal">man</code> followed by the name of the command you want
to learn about, and the best place to start is perhaps the man page
about the man command itself, and you can search man pages with the
<code class="literal">apropos</code> command:</p><pre class="screen">$ man man
MAN(1)               Manual pager utils              MAN(1)

NAME
       man - an interface to the on-line reference manuals
[...]
$ apropos compress
archive_read_filter (3) - functions for reading streaming archives
archive_write_filter (3) - (unknown subject)
gzip (1)             - compress or expand files
[...]</pre></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="_exercise_one"></a>Exercise One</h2></div></div></div><div class="sidebar"><div class="titlepage"></div><p>Compress all of the files in a directory that don’t match the <code class="literal">*.gz</code>
suffix.</p><p>In the <code class="literal">test-data</code> directory of the repo will find a number of files,
some of which are compressed, and some of which aren’t.</p><p>The command to use for the compression is <code class="literal">gzip</code>.</p></div><p>Bash (and shells in general) make the general assumption that what you
are trying to do is execute system commands, and so that is it’s
default interpretation of what you want to do, with everything else as
just glue that sticks those elements together.</p><p>Naturally, this is what makes Bash well suited to automating system
administration tasks, as these can usually be achieved with very
little extra code: you can just run your tasks immediately, as you
would type them without any preamble or configuration.</p><p>For example, one way we might solve this exercise in Scala would be a
program like this:</p><pre class="programlisting">import java.io.File

def process(f: File, indent: Int = 0): Unit = {
  if(f.isDirectory)
    for(child &lt;- f.listFiles) process(child)
  else if(!f.getName.endsWith(".gz"))
    /* ... either call out to `gzip` or use the JDK library... */
    Runtime.getRuntime.exec(Array("gzip", f.getPath))
}

process(new File("."))</pre><p>Once you have a couple of pieces in place, you should be able to write
the equivalent in Bash in a couple of lines (but naturally there are
many different ways to do this, none of which are wrong…)</p><p>There are various situations in which Bash will replace special text
with some computed values, and this is usually referred to in the docs
as <code class="literal">EXPANSION</code>, e.g parameter expansion, filename expansion etc. Not
suprisingly the latter is for finding and inserting files that match a
wildcard patterns (this also has the charming moniker <code class="literal">globbing</code> in
shell parlance).</p><p>To get an idea of the wildcards you have available, take a look at the
Bash man page (<a class="ulink" href="http://linux.die.net/man/1/bash" target="_top">http://linux.die.net/man/1/bash</a>): there is a whole
section about different types of Expansion, look specifically
"Pathname Expansion".</p><p>By default you are limited to a couple of simple wildcards, but when
the <code class="literal">extglob</code> (for extended globbing) setting is enabled you have
significantly more options available:</p><pre class="screen">$ ls
a.gz  b  c.gz
$ ls !(*.gz)
bash: !: event not found
$ shopt -s extglob
$ ls !(*.gz)
b</pre><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0; margin-right: 10%;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>Why is this behind an option? Backwards compatibility: if you try to
use the pattern that you need without setting this option, you will
get an error caused by the fact that it already has another meaning.</p></div><p>Another point to note is that the Scala example is descending the
directory recursively. One way to achieve this in Bash might be to
adopt embrace the Unix philosophy of re-using and combining smaller
tools to get the job done. For example, you’ve got <code class="literal">find</code>
(<a class="ulink" href="http://linux.die.net/man/1/find" target="_top">http://linux.die.net/man/1/find</a>) which will do this for you, and you
can usefully combine it with <code class="literal">xargs</code>
(<a class="ulink" href="http://linux.die.net/man/1/xargs" target="_top">http://linux.die.net/man/1/xargs</a>).</p><p>Or, again you can delve into the many options of Bash:</p><pre class="screen">$ ls *.gz
a.gz  c.gz
$ ls */*.gz
dir1/a.gz
$ shopt -s globstar
$ ls **/*.gz
a.gz  c.gz  dir1/a.gz  dir1/dir2/c.gz</pre></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="_writing_scripts"></a>Writing scripts</h2></div></div></div><p>Everything that you write on the Bash command line can be put into a
file and executed as a script. The simplest way to run it is just to
pass it along as the first argument to a new instance of Bash (the
<code class="literal">cat</code> command will dump the contents of a file to the screen):</p><pre class="screen">$ cat hello.sh
echo "hello world"
$ bash hello.sh
hello world</pre><p>Another way to do it is to add the execute permission and add a
special line at the top which tells the OS to pass the file to Bash:</p><pre class="screen">$ cat hello.sh
#!/bin/bash
echo "hello world"
$ chmod u+x hello.sh
$ ./hello.sh
hello world
$ mv hello.sh hello
$ ./hello
hello world</pre><p>In both of these instances, a new copy of Bash will be run which will
house the script while it runs. This means that it won’t be able to
access the variables and other things that owned by the starting
instance.</p><p>In that case, you can either use the <code class="literal">source</code> command to execute the
commands from the file in the same environment exactly as if you typed
them at the command line, or you can <code class="literal">export</code> those resource to
child processes.</p><pre class="screen">$ ./hello
hello world
$ bash ./hello.sh
Hello
$ cat hello.sh
echo "Hello $NAME"
$ NAME="Superman"
$ bash hello.sh
Hello
$ source hello.sh
Hello Superman
$ export NAME=Spiderman
$ bash hello.sh
Hello Spiderman</pre></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="_exercise_two"></a>Exercise Two</h2></div></div></div><div class="sidebar"><div class="titlepage"></div><p>Add up the total size of all of the files in a directory.</p><p>Search for <code class="literal">Arithmetic Expansion</code> in the man page to find the way to
add numbers together.</p><p>You will also find the <code class="literal">stat</code> command useful for this (although there
are pleny of other ways to get this information).</p></div><p>This provides a good example of why shell scripts can often be very
fiddly, because things which are easy in traditional programming
languages can be difficult in Bash as it requires you to jump through
hoops to shift into <code class="literal">programming mode</code>.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="_conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div></div><p>We have looked at what Bash is, and just as importantly what it
<span class="strong"><strong>isn’t</strong></span>. Hopefully you have also gained some signposts that will point
the way to getting documention on things you don’t understand when
reading existing scripts. We have also seem some of the subtlties that
can confuse beginners with unexpected behaviour when running scripts.</p><p>There are of course a lot more commands and other odds and ends that
make up Bash’s full toolset, and we will cover these in later
sessions.</p></div></div></body></html>
